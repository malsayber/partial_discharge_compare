"""
This script provides a generalized framework for executing various machine learning
experiment pipelines, as defined in the project's `config.yaml` file. It is designed
to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy definition and execution of different
experimental setups, from baseline models to complex feature engineering and selection tracks.

The script orchestrates the following key stages of a typical ML pipeline:
1.  **Data Ingestion & Pre-processing**: Loads raw data and applies initial cleaning and transformation steps.
2.  **Feature Engineering**: Extracts a wide range of features from the pre-processed data.
3.  **Feature Combination & Expansion**: Creates new features through mathematical operations or interactions.
4.  **Feature Selection**: Applies various techniques to select the most relevant features for modeling.
5.  **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains and evaluates machine learning models on the selected features.

The script is driven by the configurations specified in `config.yaml`, which defines the
different experiments to be run. Each experiment can have its own unique combination of
settings for each stage of the pipeline.

To run this script, you can execute it from the command line:
    python experiment_runner.py

The script will then iterate through all the defined experiments in the configuration
file, executing each one in sequence and logging the results.
