generate a python file and codebased based on the following requirements:
1. **Load Data**: Utilize standard datasets (e.g., Iris dataset) , ensuring proper handling of data sources and formats.

2. **Process Data**:
    - **Feature Scaling**: Apply appropriate scaling techniques (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) to normalize feature values.
    - **Train-Test Split**: Divide data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

3. **Evaluate Models**:
    - **Model Selection**: Assess various traditional machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVMs, Random Forests, XGBoost) with multiple hyperparameter settings.
    - **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure robust performance metrics.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
    - **Feature Selection**: Systematically test different feature subsets to identify the most impactful features.
    - **Automated Tools**: Leverage feature selection packages like `featurewiz`, `featuretools`, and `mljar-supervised` for efficient feature engineering.

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
    - **Optimization Techniques**: Employ advanced methods such as Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, or Particle Swarm Optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters. citeturn0academia2
    - **Automated Tools**: Utilize libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt for efficient hyperparameter search.

6. **Result Analysis**:
    - **Comparative Analysis**: Summarize model performance across different feature combinations and parameter settings.
    - **Performance Metrics**: Summarize model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
    - **Visualization**: Use plots (e.g., ROC curves, precision-recall curves) to visualize and compare model metrics.

7. **Code Modularity**:
    - **Separation of Concerns**: Organize code into distinct modules (e.g., `data_loader.py`, `data_processor.py`, `model_runner.py`, `parameter_tuner.py`, `feature_selector.py`, `main.py`) for maintainability and reusability.
    - **Configuration Management**: Implement configuration files or argument parsers to manage experiment settings systematically.
    - Reusability: Develop functions and classes that can be easily reused across different projects.

8. **Resource Management**:
    - **CPU/GPU Utilization**: Provide options to select between single-threaded or multi-core CPU processing, and single or multiple GPU usage, with checks for hardware availability.
    - **Efficient Computing**: Implement parallel processing or distributed computing when handling large datasets or complex models.

9. **Training Management**:
    - **Checkpointing**: Save model checkpoints during training to resume from the last saved state in case of interruptions.
    - **Early Stopping**: Monitor training metrics to halt training when performance plateaus, preventing overfitting.

10. **Logging and Monitoring**:
    - **Individual Logs**: Maintain logs for each model training session, capturing details like training duration, hyperparameters, and performance metrics.
    - **Master Log**: Aggregate information from all training sessions into a comprehensive log for overarching analysis.

11. **Model Evaluation and Selection**:
    - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate models using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to capture different performance aspects.
    - **Model Recommendation**: Based on evaluation metrics, recommend the best-performing model for deployment.

12. **Model Serialization**:
    - **Pickle Format**: Save models in `.pkl` files for easy loading and inference in Python environments.
    - **ONNX Format**: Export models to the Open Neural Network Exchange (`.onnx`) format for interoperability across different platforms and languages.

13. **Version Control and Reproducibility**:
    - **Code Versioning**: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track code changes and collaborate effectively.
    - **Environment Management**: Document and manage dependencies using tools like `pipenv` or `conda` to ensure consistent environments across setups.

14. **Documentation and Reporting**:
    - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for code modules, functions, and classes to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
    - **Experiment Reports**: Generate detailed reports summarizing experiments, methodologies, and findings to communicate results effectively.
15. All the code should be inside a folder called `ml_flow` and the data should be inside a folder called `data` and the log should be inside a folder called `log` and the model should be inside a folder called `model`
