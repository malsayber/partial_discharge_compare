# MLJAR Supervised

The mljar-supervised is an Automated Machine Learning Python package that works with tabular data. It is designed to save time for a data scientist. It abstracts the common way to preprocess the data, construct the machine learning models, and perform hyper-parameters tuning to find the best model 🏆. It is no black box, as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed (with a detailed Markdown report for each ML model).
