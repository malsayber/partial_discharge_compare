# Architecture Overview

The repository is organized to support feature extraction and machine learning experiments on partial discharge signals. Key modules include:

- **feature_extraction/**: domain-specific features
- **ml/**: dataset loading, preprocessing, model training and evaluation
- **reports/**: utilities to generate HTML reports via MNE

Experiments and parameters are configured in `ml/config.yaml` for reproducibility.
